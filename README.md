Berserk is a top down 2d retro style pixel game that is based on the theme: “Delay the inevitable”. In this game the player is doomed to die unless the level is cleared from enemies and destructable objects, meaning you can also win. AND the game has a custom map editor which supports export and import of your own custom made maps. Make maps, export, challenge your friends!

The game have stats such as Damage, Speed and Dexterity that all makes the game easier to play and might benefit you when playing your friends custom map!
